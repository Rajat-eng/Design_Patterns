public class Keyboard {
    // Keyboard implementation
}

public class Computer {
    private Keyboard keyboard;

    public Computer() {
        this.keyboard = new Keyboard(); // High-level module depends on low-level module
    }
}

In this example, the Computer class is tightly coupled with the Keyboard class, making it hard to change or extend.
